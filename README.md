# Mobile Concussion Screening

The King Devick Concussion Test is an easy way to conduct a sideline assessment for a potential concussion. It begins by checking for NFL guideline “No go” symptoms, any of which result in recommendation for disqualification. If the player passes this initial "No go" assessment, the King-Devick test is used. Each player will establish a baseline time to complete the test. A deviation of more than 3 seconds is a good indication that the player is concussed and should be removed from play.
